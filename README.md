# Rock Paper Scissors Python Submission v1.0

## Overview

This is my submission for the Rock Paper Scissors Coding Challenge, written in Python. It is a simple and fun game that runs in the terminal, where you can play rock paper scissors against the computer.

## Features

- The game uses the random module to generate the computer's move
- The game uses the input function to get the user's move
- The game uses the if-elif-else statements to compare the moves and determine the winner
- The game uses the print function to display the result and the score
- The game uses a while loop to repeat the game until the user quits
